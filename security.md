Security at tchzo
The security of your data is of utmost importance to us here at tchzo. 

Security maintenance includes:


Encryption
All customer interaction with tchzo servers is encrypted through the use of SSL. Our SSL certificates use 256-bit encryption to protect your data. Data is encrypted at rest with AES-256, block-level storage encryption.


Disaster Recovery
Data is backed up offsite daily for recovery from disasters. Daily logical backups are retained for 7 days. Our provider offers a continuous protection mechanism of disaster recovery and our recovery point objective (RPO) in the event of disaster is within 24 hours. Due to our multi-tenanted environment we havenâ€™t set an RTO.


Data Retention and Location
tchzo stores the minimum amount of data required in order to provide our services. Customer, proposal and pricing data must be stored by tchzo, but credit cards details are stored by PCI compliant service partners.

tchzo securely and indefinitely retains data unless deletion is requested by the principle of the account. Servers housing data are located within the United States of America.


Financial Security
Credit card details are never stored by tchzo. Credit cards are transmitted directly to our payment providers over SSL connections and are not logged or stored in tchzo systems.

Subscription payments are processed securely by a PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant service provider.

Customer payments are processed by Razorpay, a PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant provider. tchzo connects to Razorpay using its secure js file.


Password Security
Password security is maintained through minimum passwords lengths and automatic lockout on repeated login failures.

To maximise your safety, tchzo recommend your password be at least 10 characters with a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation characters.
